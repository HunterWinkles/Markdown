# Project Change Request  

## Proposed Change  
Add an embedded interactive map from WindyLinks to the **index.html** page of the website. The map will be customized to display the user’s local area and link to the full Windy.com site when clicked.  

## Reasons for the Change  
The stakeholder (instructor) requested the addition of this feature to provide users with more engaging, location-specific content. The embedded map will enhance the interactivity of the website and align with the stakeholder’s vision for improving user experience.

## How This Change Will Add Value  
- Offers a visually dynamic feature that enriches the website.  
- Provides visitors with useful, real-time geographic or weather information.  
- Demonstrates the ability to incorporate third-party content, a valuable skill in web development.  
- Makes the site feel more professional and interactive, beyond static text and images.  

## How This Change Will Affect the Constraints  
- **Scope**: Slightly expanded to include integration of a third-party embed code.  
- **Time**: Minimal additional development time (approximately 1–2 hours to embed, test, and document).  
- **Cost**: No direct costs, as WindyLinks provides free embed options.  
- **Quality**: Neutral to positive impact. If properly embedded, the feature increases perceived quality and interactivity. Poor implementation could affect layout or responsiveness.  
- **Resources**: Requires only basic HTML/CSS knowledge and access to WindyLinks embed code.
